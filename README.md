# IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Virtual Servers Secure Build Server

By using Hyper Protect Secure Build (HPSB), you can build a trusted container image within a secure enclave that is provided by IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Virtual Servers for VPC (HPVS for VPC). The enclave is highly isolated, where developers can access the container only by using a specific API and the cloud administrator cannot access the contents of the container. Therefore, the image that is built can be highly trusted. Specifically, the build server cryptographically signs the image, and a manifest (which is a collection of materials that are used during the build, for audit purposes). Since the enclave protects the signing keys within the enclave, the signatures can be used to verify whether the image and manifest are from the build server, and not elsewhere.


To setup and use HPSB in IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Virtual Servers for VPC, see [SBS Deployment on HPVS for VPC ](SBS-VPC.md).

**Note:** It is recommend that you use IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Virtual Servers for VPC, which is the next generation of IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Virtual Servers that offers an hourly billing, and improved logging support, beside other benefits.
